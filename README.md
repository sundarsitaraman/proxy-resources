# AWS CloudFormation Starter Playbook

## Introduction

This repository provides a starter template for getting started creating AWS infrastructure using Ansible and CloudFormation.

## Prerequisites

To run this playbook on your local machine, you must install the following prerequisites:

- Ansible 2.4 or higher
- Python PIP package manager
- The following PIP packages:
  - awscli
  - boto3
  - netaddr
- jq

You must also configure your local environment with your AWS credentials and you will also need to specify the ARN of the IAM role that your playbook will use to run provisioning tasks.  Your credentials must have permissions to assume this role.

### macOS Environments

On macOS environments it is recommended that you use the Homebrew package manager to install the most recent version of Python 2.7.

See [brew.sh](http://brew.sh) for details on how to install Homebrew.

Once Homebrew is installed you can install the latest version of Python 2.7 as follows:

```bash
$ brew install python@2
...
...
```

This will install the PIP package manager as `pip2` and you can install Ansible and required dependencies:

```bash
$ pip2 install ansible awscli boto3 netaddr
...
...
```

Note that `boto3` must also be installed in the system python, which you can perform as follows:

```bash
$ sudo -H /usr/bin/python -m easy_install pip
...
...
$ sudo -H /usr/bin/python -m pip install boto3 --ignore-installed six
...
...
```

Once you have installed `boto3` in your system python, it is recommended to run the following commands to ensure your Homebrew and system python environments are configured correctly:

```
$ brew unlink python
...
$ brew link --overwrite python
...
```

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your own new repository
2. Review [`roles/requirements.yml`](./roles/requirements.yml) and modify if required
3. Install roles by running `make roles` (which executes `ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml`)
4. Define environments in the [`inventory`](./inventory) file and [`group_vars`](./group_vars) folder.  Alternatively you can use the `make environment/<environment-name>` command.
5. Define a CloudFormation stack name in [`group_vars/all/vars.yml`](./group_vars/all/vars.yml) using the `Stack.Name` variable
6. Add the ARN of the IAM role to assume in each environment by configuring the `Sts.Role` variable in `group_vars/<environment>/vars.yml`
7. Define your CloudFormation template in [`templates/stack.yml.j2`](./templates/stack.yml.j2).  Alternatively you can reference a template included with the `aws-cloudformation` role by setting the `Stack.Template` variable to the path of the template relative to the `aws-cloudformation` role folder (e.g. `Stack.Template: templates/network.yml.j2`)
8. Define environment-specific configuration settings as required in `group_vars/<environment>/vars.yml`
9. If you have stack inputs, define them using the syntax `Stack.Inputs.<Parameter>` in your environment settings file (e.g. `Stack.Inputs.MyInputParam: some-value`)
10. Deploy your stack by running `make deploy/<environment>` (which executes `ansible-playbook site.yml -e env=<environment>`)

## Conventions

- Environment specific settings should always be formatted `Config.<Parameter>` (e.g. `Config.VpcName`), unless you have environment specific settings for variables related to the [`aws-sts`](https://github.com/docker-production-aws/aws-sts) or [`aws-cloudformation`](https://github.com/docker-production-aws/aws-cloudformation) roles as defined below

- Variables related to configuring the [`aws-sts`](https://github.com/docker-production-aws/aws-sts) role are formatted `Sts.<Parameter>` (e.g. `Sts.Role`)

- Variables related to configuring the [`aws-cloudformation`](https://github.com/docker-production-aws/aws-cloudformation) role formatted `Stack.<Parameter>` (e.g. `Stack.Name`)
